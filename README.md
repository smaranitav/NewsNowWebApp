# NewsNowWebApp
Created a responsive web application (RWD) using ReactJS to display news using Guardian News API and NYTimes API. 
The web application uses Bing Autosuggest API to search for news pertaining to a search keyword. To provide for an interactive session,
Comment-Box API is used for posting comments on a news post. The “word cloud” feature forms a word cloud from the top trending keywords.
Implemented AJAX calls from ReactJS application deployed on Azure to the backend Node.js code deployed on AWS .
